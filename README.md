> Hi, I’m @ameliaruthmoore!

> I'm a second year student at UTM, I also do work for ACCN Toronto in a(n) computer science/IT-like position.

> I hope to make my own RPG someday, though I'm unsure of how to start at the moment.

> Right now, everything but making websites interests me most.

> I really like systems and seeing how little puzzle pieces and clues fall into place to create something that works well on a massive scale.

> I'm hoping to learn more about computer science and how the whole system of a program/computer works!
